Less is a command line utility that displays the contents of a file or a command output, one page at a time. It is similar to more, but has more advanced features and allows you to navigate both forward and backward through the file.
When starting less doesnâ€™t read the entire file which results in much faster load times compared to text editors like vim or nano .
